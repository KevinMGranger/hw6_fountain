I know this assignment is very late, I apologize. Dock what you must.

I desided to focus on one singular fountain, made of multiple component shapes.
While implementing this, I realized the attractiveness of abstracting multiple variable-point shapes,
which I will investigate for the future.

I also wanted to create the concept of a "spout" instead of creating one particle per frame.

I also liked the concept of perlin-noised particles.

And the background is pretty cool. It's from http://wallbase.cc/wallpaper/2395251
